# Demonstrator Request Processes

## Academic/Student Process
* Academic makes a request
* Student applies for a request and email is sent to the Academic
* Academic accepts request and an email is sent to the student asking them to confirm they accept

### If student declines position
('Declines' can be a manual process or just no action by the student in X-days)

* An email is sent to the Academic so they can choose someone else - END

### If student accepts position
* An email is sent to the Academic letting them know
* If the student already has a contract we are done - END
* Otherwise, an email is sent to 'Admins' letting them know
* Email sent to student asking them to fill in paperwork

## Admin Process
* If student already has a contract - END
* Admins do whatever to get the contract via HR

### If HR contract goes through
* Admins mark the student as having a contract in the system
* Email to the student

### If HR contract is denied/fails?
* Admins mark it in the system?
* Email is sent to student _and_ Academic?

## Rules/Edge Cases?
* Academic can only change a request if there are no applicants for it?
* Academic can only delete a request if there are no accepted applicants?
  * If there were any pending applicants, they are sent an email saying the position was withdrawn?
* Student can only automatically withdraw their application if it is not yet accepted?
* How does a student 'manually' withdraw - and what happens?
* How does an academic change their mind about things?

## Email/delays

* When student applies for a position - emails are bundled up per hour/day?
* When academic accepts a student - delay mail to student by 5-10 mins?
* When student accepts a position - emails are bundled up per hour/day?
* When contract comes through - email right away?
