# Demonstrator Request Processes

## Academic/Student Process
* Academic makes a request (are there any limits?)
* Student applies for a request and email is sent to the Academic (bundled by some time)
* Academic accepts request and an email is sent to the student asking them to confirm they accept (5 minute delay) and has to check that the notification should actually be sent or not (if student changes their mind)

### If student declines position
('Declines' can be a manual process or just no action by the student in X-days)

* An email is sent to the Academic so they can choose someone else - END (group by half hour email - incase student declines multiple requests for the same academic)

### If student accepts position
* An email is sent to the Academic letting them know (group by half hour - see above)
* If the student already has a contract we are done - END
* Otherwise, an email is sent to 'Admins' letting them know (instant)
* Email sent to student asking them to fill in paperwork (instant - 1 per student)

## Admin Process
* If student already has a contract - END
* Admins do whatever to get the contract via HR

### If HR contract goes through
* Admins mark the student as having a contract in the system
* Email to the student (instant)

### If HR contract is denied/fails?
* Admins mark it in the system?
* Email is sent to student _and_ Academic? (instant for both)

## Rules/Edge Cases?
* Academic can only change a request if there are no applicants for it?
* Academic/admin can only delete a request if there are no accepted (by students) applicants?
  * If there were any pending applicants, they are sent an email saying the position was withdrawn? (instant)
* Student can only automatically withdraw their application if it is not yet accepted?
* How does a student 'manually' withdraw - and what happens? -- admins manually withdraw them 
*       - email is sdent to student letting them, know "if you do not think this is correct.... you must inform the teaching office within X-days" 24hrs
*           non-ajax form send instantly with appropriate info (i.e multiple withdrawals)
* How does an academic change their mind about things?  Ignore :-D

## Email/delays

* When student applies for a position - emails are bundled up per hour/day?
* When academic accepts a student - delay mail to student by 5-10 mins?
* When student accepts a position - emails are bundled up per hour/day?
* When contract comes through - email right away?
