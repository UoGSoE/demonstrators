Dear {{$forenames}},

Thank you for confirming your acceptance.  You will now be required to complete the steps detailed in our previous email in order to arrange your contract in advance of commencing work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PERFORM ANY WORK FOR THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING UNTIL THESE STEPS ARE COMPLETED AND YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL CONFIRMING THAT YOU MAY WORK IN YOUR SELECTED CAPACITY ON YOUR SELECTED COURSE

PLEASE REMEMBER THAT ONLY ONE CONTRACT WILL BE ISSUED TO COVER ALL OF YOUR TEACHING ASSISTANT WORK WITH THE SCHOOL

As described, you should complete and return the Extended Workforce details form to the Teaching Office (re-attached from previous email).  You should also bring your Passport and, if applicable, your visa, in order to perform your Right to Work (RtW) check.  Your RtW check will be confirmed by email within one working day - if you do not receive this email by the end of the following working day, please contact the Teaching Office.

Following your Right to Work check, preparation of your contract will commence.  Please note that this process typically takes 2-4 weeks from completion of the RtW check.  Once your contract has been prepared and sent to you, you will be obliged to sign and return the contract to the Teaching Office.  Following receipt of your signed contract, you will be sent an email by the end of the next working day for each course and function for which you have been accepted confirming that you may commence work.  You will not be able to perform any work on your selected course or function prior to receipt of this email.
