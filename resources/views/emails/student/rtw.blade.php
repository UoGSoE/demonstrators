1. Please find attached the Extended Workforce details form.

3. You will also be required to complete a Right to Work (RtW) check.  Please bring your passport and, if applicable, your visa to the Teaching Office along with your Extended Workforce form.  Staff at the Teaching Office need to see original documents and will take a scan of them. It is essential to perform this check for every employee, including Home, EU  and International nationals, and regardless of whether a contract has previously been held during the validity of your current passport / visa.

Following your Right to Work check, preparation of your contract will commence.  Please note that this process typically takes 2-4 weeks from completion of the RtW check.  Once your contract has been prepared and sent to you, please sign and return the contract to the School of Engineering H.R. Office, Rm 721 Rankine Building or the Teaching Office in the James Watt South Bldg.  Following receipt of your signed contract, you will be sent an email by the end of the next working day for each course and function for which you have been accepted confirming that you may commence work.  You will not be able to perform any work on your selected course or function prior to receipt of this email.

Kind regards,

School of Engineering
