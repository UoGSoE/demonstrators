#Teaching Assistants

This is the system for staff to request demonstrators for their courses & for students to apply.

### Process Overview

* Staff input the details of how many demonstrators and hours etc they need for a course.
* Students can log in and apply for demonstrator positions.
* Staff can then accept those applications.
* Students then have to confirm that they accept the staff's acceptance.
* Then student has to complete/confirm their right to work with the teaching office (they are emailed the form as part of the previous step).
* Admin mark a student's right to work received in the database that triggers an email to the student saying it has been received.
* Admins do their HR part in producing a contract
* Once contract has been sent to the student and returned to the teaching office, admins fill in the contract dates in the system.


### Staff Requests

When staff make their requests, they should fill in the following:

* Start Date
* Total Hours per Teaching Assistant
* Training Hours (not required)
* Number of demonstrators
* Semesters
* Special requirements (not required)

Staff can see who has applied and toggle them as accepted. If they do not want the student, they just leave it untoggled.

### Students Applications

Students press the APPLY button on the request they wish to apply for.

Once they have been accepted, they will be prompted to confirm if they still want the position or not.

Students can fill in a notes section at the top of the page that will be sent to each application they send.
